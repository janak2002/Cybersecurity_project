# Cybersecurity_project

Here's all the code for cybersecurity project on password managers.

TO UNCLOK THE SCREEN USE THE PASSWORD: tisiglup
It was already set during the testing and we thought it would be better if we simply offer a test one in case you'd like to check out the program yourself.

Unfortunately, so far the code isn't perfect. It has some small mistakes that have to do with the way I've written the classes. I know how to fix them but didn't yet have time to do so.

When you run the code you can put in data in 3 out of 4 categories but sometimes if you change a lot betweem categories, the dictionaries containing them will get messed up. What you can definitely do is input some logins, two cards and some secure notes. You can close the app and open it again and the stuff will be there. Delete buttons work only when you input a new login as well. So, you can't just delete a login, close the app and expect it to not be there when you open the app again, because it will. There is a max of 7 passwords, 2 cards for now because otherwise it goes out of the window. This can also be fixed as discussed in the report.

This prototype can take info from you in, encrypt and decrypt without fail. Edit button works fine but the delete one messes up in specific cases. All in all this model has the most of it done and the mentioned mistakes can be solved with maybe an hour or two more worth of coding.
